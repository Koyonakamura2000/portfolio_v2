            unorderedList={['How do people currently engage in night-time reflection?', 'What is the emotional experience of reflecting at night?', 
            "What are people's attitudes toward using technological interventions (e.g., smartphones) at night?"]}></ProjectColumn>
            <ProjectColumn id='interviews' heading='User Research: Interviews' text='I developed a semi-structured interview protocol to answer the questions above. With the help of my teammates, I recruited four interview participants who had varying degrees of engagement with reflection. *Names and photos are anonymized'></ProjectColumn>
            <Participants>
                <Participant image={paulPhoto} name='Paul' description='Paul engages himself with his phone or TV until he is exhausted, which helps him fall asleep immediately. He tries to avoid reflecting because thinking about things he has to do fills him with anxiety.' quotes={["...anxious about the future and I [don't] like thinking about past events.", "I'm normally consumed with one issue that I have."]}></Participant>
                <Participant image={kylePhoto} name='Kyle' description='Kyle typically reflects at night once out of every three nights, usually triggered by anxiety or recent academic shortcomings.' quotes={["It's always after I do poorly on a midterm, I don't do any of my homework, my reflection is like, 'how did I get here?' 'what led to this?' 'why do I keep making the same mistakes?'"]}></Participant>
                <Participant image={seanPhoto} name='Sean' description='Sean interacts with a lot of technology as he prepares to sleep, such as his phone and Amazon Alexa. He finds himself reflecting more when something upsetting recently happened.' quotes={["If there's something sad that happened... I try to reflect a bit more.", "If I don't reflect and I don't think about anything, it's easy for me to fall asleep."]}></Participant>
                <Participant image={toniPhoto} name='Toni' description='Toni engages in night-time reflection every day. If he is tired, he would spend between 15 to 30 minutes before falling asleep, but if not, he might spend as much as an hour reflecting. To prepare himself for sleep, he listens to guided meditation on his phone.' quotes={["I don't stress when I'm reflecting.", "I don't like it when [reflection] is too long."]}></Participant>

The possibility of spending an excessive time reflecting influenced participants to prefer avoiding reflection.'}, {'heading': 'Triggers of night-time reflection', 'text': 'Night-time reflective behavior was triggered by a number of factors.
